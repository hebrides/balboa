Light hearted and fun app to cheer up friends. 

I made this to see if I could easily parse a query string onload (yes, it's trivial). 

Long term, one to create or work on on a fully independent software creation and distribution framework that frees the internet from the client-server model that still dominates and distorts its potential to make the world freer and more democratic. I would like to make a distributed (peer to peer) market app to compete with, and hopefully replace, current monoliths.

For now, keep chasin' that chicken!
