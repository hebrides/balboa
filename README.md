Light hearted and fun app to cheer up friends. 

I made this to see if I could easily parse a query string onload (yes, it's trivial). 

Long term, I would like to make or work on a software creation and distribution framework that frees the internet from the client-server model that distorts its potential to make the world freer and more democratic. In particular, with such a framework, I would like to make a distributed (peer to peer) market app to compete with, and hopefully replace, current monoliths.

For now, keep chasin' that chicken!
